# Lecture notes


### EPFL Computer Science Bachelor


## Remark
- I started taking structured notes only in the third semester of my bachelor’s degree. I am completing my bachelor with a school arrangement with sport over four years, which explains why I am following courses from different academic years at the same time. I take my notes using Neovim and rely on snippets to improve efficiency and speed. I would like to thank Arthur Herbette for his help with the entire setup. These notes are not original course material: the explanations and most of the figures are taken directly from the courses and remain the property of their respective authors.

- Notes of probability and statistics are not complete and corrected because i took almost everything but they were too similar to the course handouts so I didn't use them.
